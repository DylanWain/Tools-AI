      "answer": "The grant writing experience with AI chatbot comparison 2025 is that built-in features cover the surface level \u2014 your role, basic preferences \u2014 while missing the deep context that makes AI useful for sustained work. The reasoning behind grant writing decisions, the alternatives you explored and rejected, the constraints specific to your project \u2014 these constitute the majority of valuable context, and they're exactly what gets lost between sessions."

      "answer": "Yes, but the approach depends on your grant writing workflow. Light users can often get by with better prompt habits and native settings.

Native features like Memory and Custom Instructions capture fragments, but the complete grant writing context requires either disciplined manual management or an automated persistence layer that captures and reinjects context without user effort."

      "question": "Does clearing ChatGPT's memory affect saved conversations when dealing with AI chatbot comparison 2025?",
