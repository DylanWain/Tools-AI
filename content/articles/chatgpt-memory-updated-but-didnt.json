      "answer": "Platform telemetry data on ChatGPT says memory updated but didn't, when it's been made available through research papers, paints a more nuanced picture than anecdotes. The gap between 'ChatGPT says memory updated but didn't' marketing copy and the reality of 500-token compressed summaries drives measurable user frustration and churn. Until platforms fundamentally redesign their approach to ChatGPT says memory updated but didn't, external persistent memory tools remain the most reliable path forward."
