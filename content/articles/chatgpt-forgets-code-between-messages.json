Native features like Memory and Custom Instructions capture fragments, but the complete investor relations context requires either disciplined manual management or an automated persistence layer that captures and reinjects context without user effort."

      "question": "How do I prevent losing important decisions between ChatGPT sessions when dealing with chatgpt forgets code between messages?",
      "answer": "The investor relations implications of chatgpt forgets code between messages are substantial. Your AI tool cannot reference decisions made in previous investor relations sessions, constraints you've established, or approaches you've already evaluated and rejected. The options range from quick settings adjustments to dedicated tools that handle context persistence automatically. For investor relations work spanning multiple sessions, the automated approach delivers the most complete fix."

      "answer": "The investor relations experience with chatgpt forgets code between messages is that built-in features cover the surface level \u2014 your role, basic preferences \u2014 while missing the deep context that makes AI useful for sustained work. The reasoning behind investor relations decisions, the alternatives you explored and rejected, the constraints specific to your project \u2014 these constitute the majority of valuable context, and they're exactly what gets lost between sessions."
