      "answer": "For API documentation professionals, chatgpt getting worse 2025 2026 means that every session with AI is a standalone interaction rather than a continuation of ongoing collaboration. The AI doesn't know what you discussed yesterday about API documentation, what you decided last week, or what constraints have been established over months of work. This leaves you with a choice: brief the AI yourself each session, or automate the process entirely."
