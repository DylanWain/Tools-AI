Authentication state changes can trigger perplexity not saving searches unexpectedly during normal usage, leading to sudden context loss that users often attribute to other causes incorrectly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does OpenAI's roadmap say about perplexity not saving searches?",
      "answer": "Cache invalidation plays a larger role in perplexity not saving searches than most troubleshooting documentation suggests, creating subtle timing issues that are difficult to reproduce consistently. Power users have developed elaborate workarounds that reveal just how inadequate standard perplexity not saving searches handling really is, and these workarounds themselves create additional maintenance burden, since fundamental changes to memory architecture would require significant platform investment that conflicts with current development priorities."
