      "question": "Should I wait for ChatGPT to fix why does chatgpt forget what i said natively?",
      "answer": "Yes, but the approach depends on your consulting workflow. Light users can often get by with better prompt habits and native settings.

The reasoning behind consulting decisions, the alternatives you explored and rejected, the constraints specific to your project \u2014 these constitute the majority of valuable context, and they're exactly what gets lost between sessions."

    {
      "question": "What's the ROI of fixing why does chatgpt forget what i said for my specific workflow?",
      "answer": "The consulting implications of why does chatgpt forget what i said are substantial. Your AI tool cannot reference decisions made in previous consulting sessions, constraints you've established, or approaches you've already evaluated and rejected. The options range from quick settings adjustments to dedicated tools that handle context persistence automatically. For consulting work spanning multiple sessions, the automated approach delivers the most complete fix."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much time am I actually losing to why does chatgpt forget what i said?",
      "answer": "For consulting professionals, why does chatgpt forget what i said means that every session with AI is a standalone interaction rather than a continuation of ongoing collaboration. The AI doesn't know what you discussed yesterday about consulting, what you decided last week, or what constraints have been established over months of work. This leaves you with a choice: brief the AI yourself each session, or automate the process entirely."
