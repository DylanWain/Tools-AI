Your AI tool cannot reference decisions made in previous content marketing sessions, constraints you've established, or approaches you've already evaluated and rejected.

    {
      "question": "Are memory extensions safe? Where does my data go when dealing with chatgpt merchants?",
      "answer": "Yes, but the approach depends on your content marketing workflow. If you only use AI a few times a week, tweaking your settings might be enough. For daily multi-session content marketing work where decisions compound over time, you need automated persistence \u2014 a tool that captures your complete conversation context and makes it available across all future sessions without manual intervention."
