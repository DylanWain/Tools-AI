      "question": "What are the long-term implications of ai that doesn't forget your name for AI workflows?",
      "answer": "The ai that doesn't forget your name problem first surfaced in professional environments where multi-session continuity is non-negotiable, and the impact on teams like Elena's at healthcare startup was immediate and substantial. For professionals working on patient data pipeline, this means constant context rebuilding that consumes hours every week, which explains why the market for dedicated solutions continues to grow rapidly as more professionals recognize the inadequacy of native approaches."
