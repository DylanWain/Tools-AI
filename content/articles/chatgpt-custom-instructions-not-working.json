      "answer": "Yes, but the approach depends on your financial modeling workflow. Light users can often get by with better prompt habits and native settings.

Each conversation operates in isolation \u2014 no information about your financial modeling project carries forward unless you manually provide it or a memory feature captures a compressed summary. The practical impact: every AI session about financial modeling starts at baseline regardless of how many hours you've invested in previous conversations."

      "question": "Can I use ChatGPT Projects to solve chatgpt custom instructions not working?",
      "answer": "For financial modeling specifically, chatgpt custom instructions not working stems from the stateless architecture of current AI models. Each conversation operates in isolation \u2014 no information about your financial modeling project carries forward unless you manually provide it or a memory feature captures a compressed summary. The practical impact: every AI session about financial modeling starts at baseline regardless of how many hours you've invested in previous conversations."

      "question": "How do I set up AI memory for a regulated industry when dealing with chatgpt custom instructions not working?",
      "answer": "Yes, but the approach depends on your financial modeling workflow. Your best bet begins with optimizing what the platform gives you for free before adding persistence tools for deeper coverage. For daily multi-session financial modeling work where decisions compound over time, you need automated persistence \u2014 a tool that captures your complete conversation context and makes it available across all future sessions without manual intervention."
