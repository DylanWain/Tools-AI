    {
      "question": "How does chat pdf affect research workflows?",
      "answer": "For API documentation specifically, chat pdf stems from the stateless architecture of current AI models.

Your AI tool cannot reference decisions made in previous API documentation sessions, constraints you've established, or approaches you've already evaluated and rejected. The approach starts with the free options already in your settings with each layer solving a different piece of the puzzle. For API documentation work spanning multiple sessions, the automated approach delivers the most complete fix."
