Monitoring and alerting for ChatGPT can't continue old conversations events would help tremendously but remains largely unavailable, forcing users to discover problems only after they've already caused damage, and this architectural reality is unlikely to change in the near-term platform roadmaps given the competing priorities that AI companies face.</p>\n<p>For professionals like Carlos, working as a lead developer at Fortune 100 company, this means the customer-facing platform with 10M users requires constant context rebuilding that consumes hours every week. Documentation gaps between official help pages and actual ChatGPT can't continue old conversations behavior are a consistent source of frustration for users who need reliable AI assistance for critical work, since fundamental changes to memory architecture would require significant platform investment that conflicts with current development priorities.</p>",
