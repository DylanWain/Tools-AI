      "answer": "The e-commerce optimization experience with chatgpt project files not working is that built-in features cover the surface level \u2014 your role, basic preferences \u2014 while missing the deep context that makes AI useful for sustained work.

    {
      "question": "What's the ROI of fixing chatgpt project files not working for my specific workflow?",
      "answer": "For e-commerce optimization specifically, chatgpt project files not working stems from the stateless architecture of current AI models. Each conversation operates in isolation \u2014 no information about your e-commerce optimization project carries forward unless you manually provide it or a memory feature captures a compressed summary.

The AI doesn't know what you discussed yesterday about e-commerce optimization, what you decided last week, or what constraints have been established over months of work.

Each conversation operates in isolation \u2014 no information about your e-commerce optimization project carries forward unless you manually provide it or a memory feature captures a compressed summary. The practical impact: every AI session about e-commerce optimization starts at baseline regardless of how many hours you've invested in previous conversations."

      "question": "How quickly does a memory extension start working when dealing with chatgpt project files not working?",
      "answer": "Yes, but the approach depends on your e-commerce optimization workflow. If your AI usage is sporadic, native features might handle it without extra tools. For daily multi-session e-commerce optimization work where decisions compound over time, you need automated persistence \u2014 a tool that captures your complete conversation context and makes it available across all future sessions without manual intervention."
