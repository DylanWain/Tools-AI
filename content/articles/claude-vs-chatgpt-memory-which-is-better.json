The AI doesn't know what you discussed yesterday about financial modeling, what you decided last week, or what constraints have been established over months of work. This leaves you with a choice: brief the AI yourself each session, or automate the process entirely."

Each conversation operates in isolation \u2014 no information about your financial modeling project carries forward unless you manually provide it or a memory feature captures a compressed summary. The practical impact: every AI session about financial modeling starts at baseline regardless of how many hours you've invested in previous conversations."

      "answer": "In financial modeling contexts, claude vs chatgpt memory which is better creates a specific pattern: context that should persist between sessions \u2014 project requirements, accumulated decisions, established constraints \u2014 gets discarded at every session boundary. Native features like Memory and Custom Instructions capture fragments, but the complete financial modeling context requires either disciplined manual management or an automated persistence layer that captures and reinjects context without user effort."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Claude 95 when I start a new conversation when dealing with claude vs chatgpt memory which is better?",
      "answer": "For financial modeling professionals, claude vs chatgpt memory which is better means that every session with AI is a standalone interaction rather than a continuation of ongoing collaboration. The AI doesn't know what you discussed yesterday about financial modeling, what you decided last week, or what constraints have been established over months of work. Bridging this gap requires either a manual context brief at the start of each session or an automated tool that handles persistence transparently."
