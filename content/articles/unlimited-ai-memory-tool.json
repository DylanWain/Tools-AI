      "answer": "The DevOps infrastructure experience with unlimited AI memory tool is that built-in features cover the surface level \u2014 your role, basic preferences \u2014 while missing the deep context that makes AI useful for sustained work. The reasoning behind DevOps infrastructure decisions, the alternatives you explored and rejected, the constraints specific to your project \u2014 these constitute the majority of valuable context, and they're exactly what gets lost between sessions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does ChatGPT sometimes create incorrect Memory entries when dealing with unlimited AI memory tool?",
      "answer": "For DevOps infrastructure specifically, unlimited AI memory tool stems from the stateless architecture of current AI models. Each conversation operates in isolation \u2014 no information about your DevOps infrastructure project carries forward unless you manually provide it or a memory feature captures a compressed summary. The practical impact: every AI session about DevOps infrastructure starts at baseline regardless of how many hours you've invested in previous conversations."
