      "answer": "For API documentation professionals, AI productivity chrome extensions 2025 means that every session with AI is a standalone interaction rather than a continuation of ongoing collaboration. The AI doesn't know what you discussed yesterday about API documentation, what you decided last week, or what constraints have been established over months of work.

      "answer": "Yes, but the approach depends on your API documentation workflow. For people who use AI occasionally, platform settings alone can make a noticeable difference. For daily multi-session API documentation work where decisions compound over time, you need automated persistence \u2014 a tool that captures your complete conversation context and makes it available across all future sessions without manual intervention."
